# Micahs Reddit Clone

The final portfolio project for code academys Front-End Development unit. This project will, using reddits API, will allow the searching of a subreddit and display posts, subreddits, comments, and likes.

## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux

I first wireframed the project on paper. Then I made a development roadmap: first create the scaffolding. Building the content in the header, main, aside, and lastly footer. Then populate scaffolding with information from the reddit API. Then testing the application both runs as expected and can be used on any device and browser.

## Lessons Learned: 

- How to use CSS grid to layout header, main, aside and footer.
